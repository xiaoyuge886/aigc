- [Cancel a Message Batch](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/canceling-message-batches.md): Batches may be canceled any time before processing ends. Once cancellation is initiated, the batch enters a `canceling` state, at which time the system may complete any in-progress, non-interruptible requests before finalizing cancellation.

The number of canceled requests is specified in `request_counts`. To determine which requests were canceled, check the individual results within the batch. Note that cancellation may not result in any canceled requests if they were non-interruptible.

- [Create a Message Batch](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/creating-message-batches.md): Send a batch of Message creation requests.

The Message Batches API can be used to process multiple Messages API requests at once. Once a Message Batch is created, it begins processing immediately. Batches can take up to 24 hours to complete.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)
- [Delete a Message Batch](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/deleting-message-batches.md): Delete a Message Batch.

Message Batches can only be deleted once they've finished processing. If you'd like to delete an in-progress batch, you must first cancel it.
