# Economic Research

The Economic Research team studies how AI is reshaping the economy, including work, productivity, and economic opportunity. Through rigorous data collection and analysis, we track AI's real-world economic effects and publish research that helps policymakers, businesses, and the public understand and prepare for the changes ahead.

### What We Do

We build the empirical foundation for understanding AI's economic impact. Our flagship Anthropic Economic Index tracks how AI tools are actually being used around the world and across every sector of the economy—moving beyond speculation to measure adoption patterns as they unfold. Alongside our index reports, we produce novel research that studies the implications of AI usage and diffusion—as tracked in the index—for workers, for firms, and for the broader economy.

### Why It Matters

Economic transitions create both opportunity and disruption. The speed of AI development means the stakes are unusually high. We need reliable data to inform the decisions that workers, employers, and policymakers make about the future. Our research provides evidence to address uncertainty and helps society navigate this transition in ways that are broadly beneficial.
