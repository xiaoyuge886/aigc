* **Anthropic to scale Claude on Azure**
* **Anthropic to adopt NVIDIA architecture**
* **NVIDIA and Microsoft to invest in Anthropic**

Today Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Anthropic announced new strategic partnerships. Anthropic is scaling its rapidly-growing Claude AI model on Microsoft Azure, powered by NVIDIA, which will broaden access to Claude and provide Azure enterprise customers with expanded model choice and new capabilities. Anthropic has committed to purchase $30 billion of Azure compute capacity and to contract additional compute capacity up to one gigawatt.

For the first time, NVIDIA and Anthropic are establishing a deep technology partnership to support Anthropic’s future growth. Anthropic and NVIDIA will collaborate on design and engineering, with the goal of optimizing Anthropic models for the best possible performance, efficiency, and TCO, and optimizing future NVIDIA architectures for Anthropic workloads. Anthropic’s compute commitment will initially be up to one gigawatt of compute capacity with NVIDIA Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems.

Microsoft and Anthropic are also expanding their existing partnership to provide broader access to Claude for businesses. Customers of Microsoft Foundry will be able to access Anthropic's frontier Claude models including Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Claude Haiku 4.5. This partnership will make Claude the only frontier model available on all three of the world's most prominent cloud services. Azure customers will gain expanded choice in models and access to Claude-specific capabilities.

Microsoft has also committed to continuing access for Claude across Microsoft’s Copilot family, including GitHub Copilot, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and Copilot Studio.

As part of the partnership, NVIDIA and Microsoft are committing to invest up to $10 billion and up to $5 billion respectively in Anthropic.

Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella, and NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang gathered to discuss the new partnerships:
