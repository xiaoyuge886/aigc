Anthropic is pleased to sign the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Health Tech Ecosystem pledge supporting conversational AI, a collaborative effort between government and industry to modernize healthcare data sharing and improve patient outcomes across America. CMS’s public-private collaboration recognizes that solving interoperability requires both technical innovation and coordinated partnership across the entire healthcare ecosystem.

"We're pleased to join this critical effort with the White House and CMS in improving healthcare data sharing so patients and their doctors can access complete health information when and where it's needed," said Anthropic Chief Product Officer, Mike Krieger. "This is an issue that affects Americans of all backgrounds. Healthcare silos have persisted for far too long, and we believe Anthropic’s AI technology can play a transformative role in eliminating these silos to improve the delivery of care for millions of Americans."

### **AI solutions for healthcare**

As an AI company, Anthropic brings novel capabilities that can complement existing healthcare infrastructure. Our technology can help bridge data systems and make health information more accessible to patients, working alongside the healthcare providers and systems already serving millions of Americans.

Healthcare's interoperability challenge mirrors a problem we've already solved in AI systems. The Anthropic-created Model Context Protocol enables AI to seamlessly connect with diverse data sources and applications. This can create intelligent bridges between incompatible systems through AI assistants that can securely access patient data from CMS Aligned Networks and personal health records. With patient consent, these assistants will help patients understand their health information and guide them to appropriate care when needed.

At Anthropic, we are focused on creating a healthcare ecosystem of partners who can connect easily and securely so that users can leverage their clinical and non-clinical data to better understand their health. We will work with payers, providers, data platforms and consumer technology companies to aggregate patient data and make it usable and actionable in a responsible way with Claude.

We look forward to continuing to work with policymakers across the U.S. government to ensure the opportunities AI unlocks support the American people. Sectors including healthcare, science, energy infrastructure, and citizen services can use this technology to keep the United States on the frontier of innovation—advancing our economy and communities in unprecedented ways.
