Today we're announcing Anthropic's expanded global presence with key leadership appointments, enterprise customer momentum, and new international offices across multiple continents.

This expansion reflects Anthropic's growth trajectory and increasing international demand for Claude. Anthropic has the top market share in enterprise AI\*, and our run-rate revenue has grown from $87 million at the start of 2024 to over $5 billion in August 2025—making us one of the fastest-growing technology companies in history. This momentum was reflected in Anthropic's $13 billion Series F funding round, at a $183 billion post-money valuation. Anthropic’s recent [Economic Index report](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report) found that nearly 80 percent of consumer Claude usage comes from outside the United States, with per-capita usage in countries like South Korea, Australia, and Singapore outpacing that of America’s.

Building on Paul Smith's recent appointment as Anthropic’s first Chief Commercial Officer, [Chris Ciauri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cciauri/) joins Anthropic as Managing Director of International, adding to our global leadership team as we expand our worldwide presence. Chris brings over 25 years of experience scaling enterprise technology businesses globally, most recently serving as CEO of Unily, president of EMEA at Google Cloud, and EVP and GM of EMEA at Salesforce where he helped scale the EMEA business from under $200 million to over $3 billion in revenue during his decade-long tenure.

Our international growth comes at a pivotal moment when enterprises are seeking AI models they can trust—systems that combine frontier performance with the safety and reliability required to support critical business operations. Anthropic’s global customer base has grown from under 1,000 business customers two years ago to over 300,000 today—representing more than 300x growth. This growth has been driven by our leading technical talent, our focus on safety, and our frontier research, including pioneering alignment and interpretability work, all of which contribute to Claude’s performance and reliability.

## **Global leadership for worldwide expansion**

Ciauri joins Paul Smith's international leadership group, working alongside Guillaume Princen as Head of EMEA, Hidetoshi Tojo as Head of Japan, and Kate Jensen as Head of Americas. Together, this team drives Anthropic's global go-to-market strategy and enterprise sales expansion across key markets.

"Business leaders understand that AI will be essential to winning moving forward. Some of the most important organizations around the world are partnering with Anthropic because they know we understand enterprise and what it takes for AI to work at scale across critical operations,” said Paul Smith, Anthropic’s Chief Commercial Officer. “Safety and trust are fundamental to everything we build—the foundation enterprises need when AI powers their business. These organizations know that Anthropic is the AI partner that's as committed to their success as they are."

Our EMEA expansion includes over 100 new roles across Dublin and London offices, plus our research-focused Zurich office, with plans to announce additional European office locations in the coming months. In Japan, we're officially opening our first Asia office in Tokyo and expanding local operations throughout the coming year.

"The global demand for Claude is extraordinary—from financial services in London to manufacturing in Tokyo, enterprises are trusting Claude to power their mission-critical operations,” said Chris Ciauri. “This is a key moment for Anthropic to expand the infrastructure and partnerships needed to serve this growing international customer base.”

## **Enterprise momentum across continents**

Our international expansion is driven by extraordinary customer momentum across industries and markets:

Across Europe and Asia-Pacific, organizations are using Claude as their agentic engine: [**NBIM**](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-financial-services), the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, has achieved ~20% productivity gains - equivalent to 213,000 hours and enhanced analytical capabilities for 9,000+ companies in their portfolio; the [**European Parliament**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2xtHTPDxSs&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fclaude.com%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE) deployed Claude to make 2.1 million historical documents accessible in multiple languages; **Novo Nordisk** reduced clinical documentation time by 99.9% (from 10+ weeks to 10 minutes) while cutting review cycles by 50%; **SK Telecom** in South Korea improved customer service quality by 34% for millions of users; **Commonwealth Bank of Australia** reduced customer scam losses by 50%; and **Rakuten** in Japan cut feature development time by 79% using Claude Code.

The same enterprise trend is true across North America: **United Airlines** used Claude to improve its ability to personalize customer messages and improve response speeds; or **TELUS** transformed how 57,000 team members work with Claude, creating over 13,000 custom AI solutions and enabling engineering teams to ship code 30% faster while saving over 500,000 hours.

As we continue expanding globally, we remain committed to building reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems that enterprises can trust for their most critical operations. Stay tuned for more updates on our enterprise momentum and international growth as we serve organizations worldwide.
