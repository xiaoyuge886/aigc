# National security expert Richard Fontaine appointed to Anthropic’s long-term benefit trust

Jun 7, 2025

Anthropic's Long-Term Benefit Trust today announced the appointment of Richard Fontaine, CEO of the Center for a New American Security, as a new member of the Trust. The Long-Term Benefit Trust (LTBT) is an independent body designed to help Anthropic achieve its public benefit mission.

Fontaine brings extensive government experience, including roles at the National Security Council, in the State Department, on Capitol Hill, and, for four years, on the Defense Policy Board. At a time when advanced AI systems increasingly impact national security, his appointment addresses the growing intersection between AI capabilities and geopolitical risks.

Buddy Shah, Chair of the Long-Term Benefit Trust, said: “As the LTBT continues to mature, Richard's extensive national security experience brings critical perspective to help guide Anthropic through the complex challenges of increasingly powerful AI and its impact on global security.”

Anthropic is a Public Benefit Corporation with a mission of ensuring a safe transition through transformative AI. The LTBT helps Anthropic achieve this public benefit mission by selecting members of Anthropic's Board of Directors, and advising the Board and leadership on how the company can maximize the benefits of advanced AI and mitigate its risks. New Trustees are selected by existing Trustees, in consultation with Anthropic, and have no financial stake in Anthropic. The Trust’s composition reflects a recognition that transformative AI will affect more than technology or business: it will reshape fundamental aspects of human society, from global health to international security to the basic functioning of democratic institutions.

Richard Fontaine said: “With transformative AI on the near-term horizon, companies must consider the profound implications for everything we care about, including our security, our jobs, and our human interactions. My conversations with Dario, Daniela, and the LTBT team made clear that Anthropic takes these challenges seriously. As the stakes get higher, the LTBT serves as a valuable mechanism to help Anthropic’s leadership navigate critical decisions. I am pleased to lend my expertise to this important work.”

Fontaine’s appointment adds deep foreign policy and national security experience to the Trust’s range of expertise, reflecting Anthropic’s commitment to supporting democracy and global stability as a core pillar of its mission.

“Richard’s expertise comes at a critical time as advanced AI capabilities increasingly intersect with national security considerations,” said Dario Amodei, CEO and Co-founder of Anthropic. “I've long believed that ensuring democratic nations maintain leadership in responsible AI development is essential for both global security and the common good. Richard’s appointment strengthens the Trust’s ability to guide Anthropic through the complex decisions that will shape not just our industry, but the global balance of power.”
