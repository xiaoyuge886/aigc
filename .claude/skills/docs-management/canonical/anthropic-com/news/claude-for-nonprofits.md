Nonprofits tackle some of society’s most difficult problems, often with limited resources. In partnership with the global generosity movement [GivingTuesday](https://www.givingtuesday.org/), we’re launching Claude for Nonprofits to help organizations across the world maximize their impact.

Many nonprofits already use Claude to meet their goals. [The Epilepsy Foundation](https://www.epilepsy.com/stories/epilepsy-foundation-launches-ai-assistant) is providing 24/7 support through Claude to 3.4 million Americans living with epilepsy. [The International Rescue Committee](https://www.rescue.org/) is using Claude to communicate with local partners and analyze field data faster in time-sensitive humanitarian settings. [IDinsight](https://www.idinsight.org/), a research organization supporting global development leaders, reports working up to 16× faster with Claude. [SkillUp](https://skillup.online/) and [Robin Hood](https://robinhood.org/) also use Claude for coding and administrative work that would otherwise require significantly more resources.

These organizations have taught us what works—and what doesn't. From our partners, we know AI helps most when it fits into existing workflows, upholds the privacy their communities expect, and is affordable.

Claude for Nonprofits includes three things: discounted access of up to 75% to Claude, connectors to new nonprofit tools—Blackbaud, Candid, and Benevity—and a free course, [AI Fluency for Nonprofits](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/ai-fluency-for-nonprofits), designed to help teams use AI more effectively.

## **Discounted access to Team and Enterprise plans**

Nonprofits are now eligible for a discount of up to 75% on Team and Enterprise plans.

Our Team plan is designed for smaller organizations looking to collaborate through shared projects and organizational knowledge. Our Enterprise plan suits larger nonprofits that need additional security features and administrative control.

At the discounted price, Claude for Nonprofits includes access to Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5. Sonnet 4.5 is best suited to sophisticated tasks like grant writing and program analysis, while Haiku 4.5 offers near-frontier performance at much faster speed. In addition, Claude Opus 4.5 is available on request - if your team is on Claude for Enterprise, you can reach out to your account team for access.

## **Connecting new services to Claude**

Claude supports a number of connectors that link AI to the platforms that teams already use, including Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Asana, Slack, and Box.

We’re now adding three open-source connectors to nonprofit tools, and we expect to launch more soon. Claude can now connect to:

* **[Benevity](https://benevity.com/),** which can be used to access more than 2.4 million validated nonprofits to support volunteering and donation searches in Claude;
* **[Blackbaud](https://www.blackbaud.com/),** which provides CRM and fundraising tools for donor management, campaign tracking, and giving optimization; and
* **[Candid](https://candid.org/),** which provides data on nonprofits and funders for the discovery of organizations, grants, and philanthropic opportunities.

This video shows how Claude uses the Benevity Connector to discover key information and search for specific nonprofits.

We’re also collaborating with [The Bridgespan Group](https://www.bridgespan.org/), [Idealist Consulting](https://idealistconsulting.com/), [Vera Solutions](https://verasolutions.org/), and [Slalom](https://www.slalom.com/us/en), who provide tailored expertise to nonprofits adopting new technologies. We’ll work together to support nonprofits with their overall strategy, impact measurement, and organization-wide implementation of AI.

## **AI Fluency for Nonprofits**

In partnership with [GivingTuesday](https://www.givingtuesday.org/), we’ve developed a free course, [AI Fluency for Nonprofits](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/ai-fluency-for-nonprofits). The curriculum focuses on how staff can use AI more effectively for grant writing, program evaluation, donor engagement, organizational efficiency, and more. It’s designed for those who are new to AI, and requires no technical background.

AI Fluency for Nonprofits is now available via our [Anthropic Academy](https://www.anthropic.com/learn). We’re supplementing this with a collection of step-by-step guides, [available here](https://claude.com/resources/use-cases/category/nonprofits), to prompt additional ideas on key nonprofit workflows like grant-writing and impact reporting.

## **Learning from our partners and customers**

We’ve partnered with the [Constellation Fund](https://constellationfund.org/), [Robin Hood](https://robinhood.org/), and [Tipping Point Community](https://tippingpoint.org/) to pilot Claude with more than 60 of their grantee organizations. This is helping us understand how to better support nonprofits as they produce grant proposals that align with funders’ interests, analyze program impact, provide large-scale donor stewardship, and generate board materials and compliance documentation.

We've also been learning from dozens of our customers across the nonprofit sector:

> With global health funding shrinking, smart targeting is essential. Claude helped us build an interactive geospatial tool in three days versus weeks, mapping at-risk populations to identify where Guatemala's Ministry of Health could most cost-effectively deploy dengue prevention.

> With AWS and Claude, we built Sage—an AI companion trained on 25,000+ pages of epilepsy expertise, now available 24/7 in 5 languages to 3.4 million Americans living with epilepsy. It embodies our promise that no one should ever have to face epilepsy alone.
