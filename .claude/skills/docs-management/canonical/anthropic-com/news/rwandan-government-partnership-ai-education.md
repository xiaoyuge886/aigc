Anthropic is announcing a new partnership with the Government of Rwanda and African tech training provider ALX to bring Chidi—a learning companion built on Claude—to hundreds of thousands of learners across Africa. Rwanda's ICT & Innovation and Education ministries are deploying Chidi within their national education system, while ALX will bring the tool to students across the continent through their technology training programs.

With this initiative, university graduates and young professionals in countries across Africa will be able to use Chidi to learn new skills, like data analytics or cloud computing. And teachers in Rwanda can use it to plan lessons and help them support their students.

This partnership represents one of the largest AI for education deployments on the continent, uniting ALX's commitment to empowering African talent, Anthropic's vision for accessible and responsible AI, and Rwanda's Vision 2050 to build an AI-ready workforce and accelerate digital transformation across Rwanda.

## Partnering with the Government of Rwanda

Through this initiative, the Rwandan government will bring AI tools directly into the national education system. The government will enable AI training for up to 2,000 teachers, as well as a group of civil servants across the country, who will learn to integrate AI into their classroom practice. This training will give them hands-on experience using Claude to support how they teach, plan lessons, and improve their productivity day-to-day.

Graduates of the Rwanda pilot will receive a year of access to Claude tools, such as Claude Pro for individuals and Claude Code for developer teams in government, while exploring Claude for Education with university educators, ensuring that this new literacy in AI continues to shape classrooms and the workplace long after the program ends.

The Rwandan government sees this initiative as central to their Vision 2050 strategy. As Rwandans begin learning how to use AI, they will help advance the government's goal of building a knowledge economy—launching startups that solve local challenges, joining global companies that need their skills, and creating innovations that reshape industries.

“Rwanda’s Vision 2050 places youth and technology at the core of national progress, and our goal is to build a workforce equipped for the opportunities of the 21st century,” said Paula Ingabire, Minister of ICT & Innovation in Rwanda. “This collaboration allows us to explore innovative AI tools that could enhance learning, support educators, strengthen developer capabilities, and provide new forms of digital assistance across selected institutions. These areas remain under review, and by beginning capacity building for civil servants, we ensure our workforce gains the foundational skills to engage with emerging technologies responsibly.”

"Rwanda's comprehensive approach to embracing and integrating AI—training teachers, involving policymakers, and building a dedicated working group—creates the foundation for responsible AI deployment,” said Elizabeth Kelly, Head of Beneficial Deployments at Anthropic. “By working with the government and ALX, we're learning how to ensure AI serves local educational needs while reaching students at scale."

## Building skills with AI across the continent

Beyond Rwanda, ALX is deploying Chidi across its technology training programs throughout Africa. As one of the continent's largest technology training providers, ALX reaches over 200,000 students and young professionals. Through this partnership, all of their students will access Claude through Chidi, which will serve as a "Socratic mentor"—guiding learners through thoughtful questions, rather than providing direct answers. This approach helps students develop independent problem-solving skills while learning to work effectively with AI tools.

Early results demonstrate Chidi's potential impact: since the tool was rolled out on November 4, learners have engaged in over 1,100 conversations and nearly 4,000 learning sessions, with nine out of ten users reporting positive experiences. Chidi is helping students work through complex coding challenges, understand data science concepts, and develop their problem-solving skills.

"This is not just about bringing technology to Africa; it's about co-creating the future of learning to unlock the continent's full potential," said Fred Swaniker, Founder and CEO of ALX. "Chidi transforms how our students build their capabilities, their confidence, and ultimately their careers. As they master AI-powered learning today, they become the architects of Africa's technology-driven future tomorrow."

## Expanding AI for public good worldwide

Today’s announcement represents a new milestone in Anthropic's commitment to ensuring AI works for the public good by reaching students globally. It builds upon our focus on education partnerships that reshape how students and educators interact with AI worldwide.

In [Iceland](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-and-iceland-announce-one-of-the-world-s-first-national-ai-education-pilots), we recently launched one of the world's first comprehensive national AI education pilots with the Ministry of Education and Children, giving teachers across the nation access to Claude to transform lesson preparation and student support. The [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/news/latest-news-from-lse/d-april/lse-partners-with-anthropic-to-shape-the-future-of-ai-in-education) has provided all students with access to Claude for Education, helping them develop critical thinking skills. And our expanded presence in [India](https://www.anthropic.com/news/expanding-global-operations-to-india), where we're opening an office in Bengaluru, focuses on supporting the country's rapidly growing developer and startup ecosystem.

These partnerships demonstrate a consistent approach to working closely with governments, educational institutions, and technology companies to ensure AI expands opportunity and serves the communities where it's deployed.

We look forward to learning from these deployments, sharing what we've learned with the wider community, and continuing to support educators and learners as they shape AI's role in building our future.
