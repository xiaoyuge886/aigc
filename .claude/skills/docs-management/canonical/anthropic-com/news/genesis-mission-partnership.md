# Working with the US Department of Energy to unlock the next era of scientific discovery

Dec 18, 2025

Anthropic and the US Department of Energy (DOE) are announcing a multi-year partnership as part of the Genesis Mission— the Department’s initiative to use AI to cement America’s leadership in science. Our partnership focuses on three domains—American energy dominance, the biological and life sciences, and scientific productivity—and has the potential to affect the work being done at all 17 of America’s national laboratories.

The Genesis Mission recognizes that we are at a critical moment: as global competition in AI intensifies, America must harness its unmatched scientific infrastructure—from supercomputers to decades of experimental data—and combine it with frontier AI capabilities to maintain scientific leadership. Anthropic seeks to play a key role in this effort.

“Anthropic was founded by scientists who believe AI can deliver transformative progress for research itself,” said Jared Kaplan, Anthropic’s Chief Science Officer. “The Genesis Mission is the sort of ambitious, rigorous program where that belief gets tested. We’re honored to help advance science that benefits everyone.”

Brian Peters, Anthropic's Head of North America Government Affairs, attended the Genesis Mission launch event today at the White House. We are looking forward to contributing to the mission and continuing to collaborate with DOE.

## The partnership

Anthropic seeks to provide DOE researchers access both to Claude and to a team of Anthropic engineers, who can develop purpose-built tools, including:

* AI "agents" (models that take actions) for DOE’s highest-priority challenges
* Model Context Protocol servers that connect Claude to scientific instruments and tools
* Claude [Skills](https://www.claude.com/blog/skills) for specialized expertise on relevant scientific workflows

Claude can facilitate substantial advancements in:

* **Energy dominance.** Claude can help with a broad range of tasks—from speeding up permitting review processes that bottleneck America’s energy expansion to helping scientists conduct research at the frontier of nuclear technology and strengthening domestic energy security.
* **Biological and life sciences.** Claude can support the development of early-warning systems for future pandemics and biological threat detection, and be used to hasten the speed of drug discovery and development.
* **Scientific productivity.** Claude has the capacity to access fifty years of DOE research, and use this context to accelerate the research cycle in strategically important domains and provide well-informed research support in the form of new ideas to trial out, or patterns in older data that humans might have missed.

## **Our commitment to partner with the US Government**

Scientific progress has always driven America’s prosperity and security. Anthropic aspires to expand existing arrangements with DOE to build the next chapter: using AI across America’s research institutions, with deep context on scientists’ work and active support from our engineers.

Potential future arrangements would represent the next stage of Anthropic and DOE’s multi-year partnership. Past projects with DOE include co-development of a [nuclear risk classifier](https://red.anthropic.com/2025/nuclear-safeguards/) with the National Nuclear Security Administration and rolling out Claude at the [Lawrence Livermore national laboratory](https://www.anthropic.com/news/lawrence-livermore-national-laboratory-expands-claude-for-enterprise-to-empower-scientists-and). As we learn from the current work with DOE’s, we’ll be able to develop a model for how AI and human researchers can work together—and feed this back into the development of the AI tools they use.
