Anthropic and Accenture today announced a major expansion of their partnership to help enterprises move from AI pilots to full-scale deployment. Key elements of the announcement:

* Accenture and Anthropic are forming the **Accenture Anthropic Business Group**, making Anthropic one of Accenture's select strategic partners with a dedicated practice built around Claude
* Approximately 30,000 Accenture professionals will receive training on Claude, **creating one of the largest ecosystems of Claude practitioners in the world**
* Accenture becomes a premier AI partner for coding with Claude Code, which now holds over half of the AI coding market\*, making it available to **tens of thousands of its developers**
* The companies are launching a **new joint offering to help CIOs measure value and adopt AI** across their engineering organizations
* **Initial industry solutions for regulated industries**, including financial services, life sciences, healthcare, and public sector, where security and governance requirements are strictest

The announcement comes as Anthropic's enterprise market share has grown from 24% to 40%\*.

"AI is changing how almost everyone works, and enterprises need both cutting-edge AI and trusted expertise to deploy it at scale. Accenture brings deep enterprise transformation experience, and Anthropic brings the most capable models. Our new partnership means that tens of thousands of Accenture developers will be using Claude Code, making this our largest ever deployment—and the new Accenture Anthropic Business Group will help enterprise clients use our smartest AI models to make major productivity gains,” said **Dario Amodei, CEO and co-founder of Anthropic**.

“This exciting expansion of our partnership with Anthropic will help our clients accelerate the shift from experimenting with AI to using it as a catalyst for reinvention across the enterprise,” said **Julie Sweet, Chair and CEO**, Accenture. “With the powerful combination of Anthropic’s Claude capabilities and Accenture’s AI expertise and industry and function domain knowledge, organizations can embed AI everywhere responsibly and at speed—from software development to customer experience—to drive innovation, unlock new sources of growth and build their confidence to lead in the age of AI.”

## **Introducing the Accenture Anthropic Business Group**

The new Accenture Anthropic Business Group makes Anthropic one of Accenture’s select strategic partners. Accenture Business Groups are dedicated practices built around Accenture’s most important technology partnerships. Each has its own teams, go-to-market focus, and specialized expertise, reflecting the depth of investment and long-term commitment involved.

Approximately 30,000 Accenture professionals that will be trained on Claude, including forward deployed engineers (also known as “reinvention deployed engineers” at Accenture) who help embed Claude within client environments to scale enterprise AI adoption. This will comprise one of the largest ecosystems of Claude practitioners in the world. These teams combine Accenture's AI, industry, and function expertise—along with deep partnerships with leading cloud providers—with Anthropic's Claude models and Claude Code, plus its proven playbooks for regulated industries.

For Accenture’s enterprise customers, this means faster deployment with less risk. Instead of building AI capabilities from scratch, companies can tap into a ready-made bench of Claude experts to move from pilot to production immediately.

## **Launching a product to help CIOs put Claude Code at the center of software development**

Accenture and Anthropic are launching a new joint offering designed for CIOs to measure value and drive large-scale AI adoption across their engineering organizations. This is the first product from the partnership, providing a structured path to shift how enterprise software is designed, built, and maintained.

The offering puts Claude Code, which now holds over half\* of the AI coding market, at the center of the enterprise software development lifecycle, combined with three Accenture capabilities: a framework to quantify real productivity gains and ROI, workflow redesign for AI-first development teams, and change management and training that keeps pace as AI evolves. This can help enterprises turn developer productivity gains into company-wide impact for customers through faster releases, shorter development cycles, and the ability to bring new products to market sooner.

Claude Code accelerates developer productivity at every level. Junior developers produce senior-level code, completing integration tasks faster and onboarding in weeks instead of months. Senior developers shift to higher-value work, including architecture, validation, and strategic oversight.

## **Building AI offerings for regulated industries**

Accenture and Anthropic are jointly developing industry offerings with an initial focus on highly regulated industries—including financial services, life sciences, healthcare, and public sector—where organizations face the dual challenge of modernizing legacy systems while maintaining strict security and governance requirements. For example:

* Financial services: Claude’s ability to process lengthy, complex documents—combined with Accenture’s regulatory expertise—helps banks and insurers automate compliance workflows and make faster decisions with the precision required in high-stakes financial environments.
* Health and life sciences: Accenture’s expertise in life sciences R&D combined with Claude’s analytical capabilities helps researchers query proprietary datasets, generate experimental protocols, and streamline clinical trial processing.
* Public sector: AI agents that help citizens navigate complex government services—providing accurate, accessible support while maintaining data privacy and compliance with statutory requirements.

## **A partnership built on shared values**

The partnership is grounded in a shared commitment to responsible AI, combining Anthropic's constitutional AI principles with Accenture's AI governance expertise so that enterprises can use AI safely with confidence, transparency, and accountability.

To support hands-on engagement with the world's largest enterprises, Accenture is bringing Claude into its network of Accenture Innovation Hubs. These hubs serve as centers for safe AI co-creation, enabling Global 2000 clients to prototype, test, and validate AI solutions in controlled environments before enterprise-wide deployment. This addresses a critical barrier to AI adoption at scale: the need for large organizations to experiment and learn without risking production systems or sensitive data.

Anthropic and Accenture will also co-invest in a Claude Center of Excellence inside Accenture, creating a dedicated environment for the joint design of new AI offerings tailored to specific enterprise needs, industry requirements, and regulatory contexts.

## **Getting started**

Accenture clients can contact their account team to discuss deployment options. Enterprises can visit our [Enterprise page](https://www.anthropic.com/enterprise) to learn more about Claude. Claude is the only frontier model available on all three of the world's most prominent cloud services, including Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, and Microsoft Azure.
