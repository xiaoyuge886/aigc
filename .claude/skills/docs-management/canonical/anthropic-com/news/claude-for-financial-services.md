Financial institutions require the highest standards of data protection. By default, your data is not used for training our generative models, maintaining confidentiality of your intellectual property and client information.

## The AI ecosystem for financial services

We've built the Financial Analysis Solution with leading financial and enterprise technology providers, giving Claude the ability to instantly check information across multiple sources. This creates a fundamentally more reliable way to analyze financial data—information is verified across sources to reduce errors, every claim links directly to its original source for transparency, and complex analysis that normally takes hours happens in minutes.
