# Claude Gov models for U.S. national security customers

Jun 6, 2025

We’re introducing a custom set of Claude Gov models built exclusively for U.S. national security customers. The models are already deployed by agencies at the highest level of U.S. national security, and access to these models is limited to those who operate in such classified environments.

Claude Gov models were built based on direct feedback from our government customers to address real-world operational needs, and underwent the same rigorous safety testing as all of our Claude models. The result is a set of Claude models that understands our customers’ unique national security requirements while maintaining Anthropic's unwavering commitment to safety and responsible AI development.

U.S. national security customers may choose to use our AI systems for a wide range of applications from strategic planning and operational support to intelligence analysis and threat assessment. Claude Gov models deliver enhanced performance for critical government needs and specialized tasks. This includes:

* Improved handlingof classified materials, as the models refuse less when engaging with classified information
* Greater understanding of documents and information within the intelligence and defense contexts
* Enhanced proficiency in languages and dialects critical to national security operations
* Improved understanding and interpretation of complex cybersecurity data for intelligence analysis

This builds on our commitment to bring responsible and safe AI solutions to our U.S. national security customers, with custom models that are built to address the unique needs of classified environments. To learn more about the Claude Gov models and see how they can support your agency's mission, you can reach our public sector team at [pubsec@anthropic.com](mailto:pubsec@anthropic.com).
