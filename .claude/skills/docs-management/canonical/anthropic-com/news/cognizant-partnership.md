Cognizant, a ​​leading information technology consulting company, announced today that it will use Claude to help its enterprise customers and internal teams move from AI experimentation to production outcomes. Cognizant will deploy Claude to up to 350,000 employees globally, combining Claude with agentic tooling, Cognizant's engineering platforms, and industry blueprints to help deliver measurable impact at enterprise scale.

Cognizant will provide Claude to employees across key corporate functions, engineering, and delivery teams, and use Claude Code to accelerate coding tasks, testing, documentation and DevOps workflows.

Cognizant will also align Claude models, Claude Code, the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and the Agent SDK with its core engineering platforms, so clients can integrate AI with existing data and applications, orchestrate multi-step work with human oversight, and more effectively manage performance, risk and spend.

“The combination of frontier AI with deep domain expertise and implementation capabilities is what makes this partnership so exciting and will absolutely accelerate AI in the enterprise," said Paul Smith, Chief Commercial Officer at Anthropic. "Companies require trusted AI that combines cutting-edge performance with safety and reliability, which is why hundreds of thousands of businesses trust Claude. We're demonstrating this at scale by rolling out Claude to up to 350,000 Cognizant employees and helping our joint clients do the same."

“Enterprises are moving beyond simple productivity gains toward a more connected, agentic future,” said Ravi Kumar S, CEO of Cognizant. “By pairing Anthropic’s Claude models and agentic tooling with Cognizant’s suite of platforms and industry expertise, we will help clients build the foundations of an agentified enterprise where intelligent systems collaborate with people to accelerate modernization, engineering and industry transformation. We are equally excited to apply Anthropic’s technology to help us drive these transformation goals internally at Cognizant.”

## **Solving real enterprise challenges**

CIOs face critical challenges: thousands of applications running on legacy code, shrinking talent pools who understand these systems, and the majority of engineering resources going to maintaining existing systems rather than building new capabilities.

This partnership directly addresses these challenges. Cognizant is deploying Claude models, Claude Code, MCP, and Agent SDK with Cognizant's software development and AI platforms to deliver:

* **Software engineering productivity**: Deploying Claude and Claude Code with Cognizant Flowsource™ Platform (which connects tools and teams across the software development process) to accelerate coding tasks, testing, documentation and DevOps workflows with MCP-based access to developer tools.
* **Legacy modernization**: Combining Cognizant's modernization frameworks with Anthropic's code understanding and transformation capabilities to speed analysis and refactoring across large codebases.
* **Agentification**: Using Cognizant Neuro® AI Multi-Agent Orchestration (which builds and coordinates multiple AI agents working together) and Anthropic's Agent SDK to design reusable, domain-specific agents and multi-agent systems that operate with explicit policies, approvals and human-in-the-loop controls.
* **Industry solutions**: Developing vertical solutions, beginning with Financial Services, leveraging Cognizant Agent Foundry (which helps enterprises build and deploy AI agents at scale) with Claude to embed agentic workflows into regulated, enterprise environments.
* **Responsible AI**: Advancing practices for safe deployment, monitoring, and operations at scale, aligned to enterprise governance needs and open standards such as MCP.

Cognizant plans to engage clients through workshops, reference patterns, and platform integrations using Claude to help teams identify high-value use cases and move them into production.
