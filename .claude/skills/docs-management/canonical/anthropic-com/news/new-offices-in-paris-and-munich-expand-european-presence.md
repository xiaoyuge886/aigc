Today, we're announcing plans to open offices in Paris and Munich as our global operations expand across Europe. These new hubs follow recent office openings in [Tokyo](https://www.anthropic.com/news/opening-our-tokyo-office), [Seoul](https://www.anthropic.com/news/seoul-becomes-third-anthropic-office-in-asia-pacific), and [Bengaluru](https://www.anthropic.com/news/expanding-global-operations-to-india) and will further grow our [European footprint](https://www.anthropic.com/news/head-of-EMEA-new-roles) alongside our offices in London, Dublin, and Zurich. They’re the latest example of Anthropic’s extraordinary momentum in Europe—and all [around the world](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-expands-global-leadership-in-enterprise-ai-naming-chris-ciauri-as-managing-director-of). In the past year, we have tripled the number of employees we have in the EMEA region and will continue to expand our headcount with the addition of these new offices.

Businesses across Europe are trusting Claude with their most important work. As a result, EMEA has become our fastest-growing region, with a run-rate revenue that has grown more than 9x in the past year. The number of large EMEA business accounts—customers that each represent over $100,000 in run-rate revenue—has also grown more than 10x over the past year.

“Europe is home to some of the world’s most important and forward-thinking companies,” said **Chris Ciauri, Anthropic’s Managing Director of International**. “The business leaders I speak to are clear-eyed on both the immense opportunity that AI development represents and the critical importance of safety, reliability, and public trust. With a bigger, broader, and highly specialized leadership team, we’re doubling down on sustained EMEA growth and building the team our European users need.”

Research from our Anthropic [Economic Index](https://www.anthropic.com/economic-index) suggests that AI is already reshaping long-established industries across the continent, from German manufacturing to French tourism to Swedish web development. Claude is enabling enterprises like [L'Oréal](https://www.claude.com/customers/loreal), BMW, SAP and Sanofi—alongside digital-native companies like Lovable, [N26](https://www.claude.com/customers/n26), Pigment, Qonto, and [Doctolib](https://www.claude.com/customers/doctolib)—to tackle key tasks like writing new computer programs, improving software, and resolving network issues in sectors where accuracy and reliability aren't optional.

As some of Europe's largest economies, Germany and France are natural hubs for us to broaden and deepen our European presence. Both countries rank among the top 20 in the world in Claude usage per capita, and both are home to leading global companies in healthcare, financial services, automotive, aerospace, and retail. Anthropic’s new Paris and Munich offices will serve as regional hubs for commercial growth, policy collaboration, and partnership development. And our European workforce will span every aspect of our business, from research and engineering to sales and operations.

As we scale across the region, we’re also building a world-class leadership team that’s focused on meeting the accelerating demand and unique needs of European enterprises and startups.

* Guillaume Princen is serving as our Head of EMEA Startups, Mid-Market and Digital Native Businesses, and is focused on driving growth in these key segments.
* Pip White, our new Head of EMEA North, will lead our go-to-market efforts across the UK and Ireland, Benelux, Nordics, and Israel, working from our London office. Pip brings 25 years of enterprise technology experience from companies including Salesforce, Google, and Slack, where she drove significant growth across UK and EMEA markets.
* Thomas Remy, our new Head of EMEA South, will oversee France, Italy, Iberia, Middle East, and Africa, and be based in our new Paris office. Thomas spent the last 11 years at Google Cloud, where he played a pivotal role in helping build the business across the region. More recently he built and led the Data & AI Go-To-Market team for EMEA, driving strategy and growth in one of cloud computing's most dynamic sectors.
* We are also going to announce a new Head of DACH & CEE, who will oversee Central and Eastern Europe, including Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, Poland, Czech Republic.

To jumpstart our new operations in France and Germany, we’re also partnering with local educational institutions and cultural organizations:

* We’re working with LAS Art Foundation to support a major exhibition to be held in Berlin next year. LAS commissions and exhibits works by internationally renowned artists at the intersection of art and technology.
* We’re supporting two hackathons hosted by [TUM.ai](https://www.tum.de/), a student initiative at the Technical University of Munich that helps train students in software development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
* We’re teaming up with Unaite, a French organization that’s building developer communities and advancing AI education, in support of two hackathons to be held in 2026.
