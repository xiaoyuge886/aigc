Today, we're announcing that Claude models are approved for use in FedRAMP High and DoD Impact Level 4 and 5 workloads through [Amazon Bedrock]( https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/anthropic/) in AWS GovCloud (US) regions.

Federal agencies and defense organizations can now access Claude's advanced AI capabilities while meeting the government’s stringent security requirements—opening new possibilities for mission-critical applications across defense, intelligence, and sensitive civilian operations.

## **Enabling secure AI for the most sensitive workloads**

DoD Impact Level 4, 5, and FedRAMP High authorizations represent the highest levels of cloud security certification for unclassified and controlled unclassified information. Claude has received approval for use in Amazon Bedrock for workloads requiring FedRAMP and DoD authorization, enabling Anthropic and AWS to support users across the full spectrum of unclassified government workloads.

Claude 3.5 Sonnet v1 and Claude 3 Haiku are now available, alongside Amazon Bedrock capabilities including Amazon Bedrock Agents, Guardrails, Knowledge Bases, and Model Evaluation, which help customers automate multistep tasks, implement customized safeguards, customize applications, and select the best suited models. Additional Claude models may be added in the future, including Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 4 models.

With Claude in Amazon Bedrock, federal agencies can now:

* Deploy frontier AI models for complex document analysis and intelligence synthesis in secure environments
* Build AI agents that process controlled unclassified information
* Leverage Claude's advanced intelligence and 200K token context window for comprehensive analysis of large datasets

## **Accelerating government AI adoption**

Our goal is to enable commercial availability of Claude models across every region where public sector customers operate, meeting the security accreditations their mission-critical workloads require. Claude on Amazon Bedrock provides a fully managed service that eliminates infrastructure complexity while maintaining required security controls.

Government customers now have flexibility to deploy some of the most capable AI systems across multiple secure platforms—including Google Cloud's Vertex AI for FedRAMP High and IL2, and Amazon Bedrock for FedRAMP Moderate and High and DoD IL2 and IL4/5.

## **Getting started**

Federal agency employees, defense contractors, and approved partners can access Claude models through Amazon Bedrock in AWS GovCloud (US) regions using familiar AWS APIs and management tools.
