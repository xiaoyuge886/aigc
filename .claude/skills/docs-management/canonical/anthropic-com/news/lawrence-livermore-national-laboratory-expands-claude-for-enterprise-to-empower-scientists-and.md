# Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory expands Claude for Enterprise use to empower scientists and researchers

Jul 9, 2025

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), one of the United States' premier research institutions, is expanding its deployment of Claude for Enterprise to its entire laboratory. This expansion will make advanced AI capabilities available to about 10,000 scientists, researchers, and staff. LLNL's expansion of Claude access will help bolster research across nuclear deterrence, energy, materials science, and energy security in one of the largest deployments of Claude for Enterprise within the U.S. Department of Energy's national laboratory system.

## Building on proven partnership

This expanded partnership between LLNL and Anthropic serves as a blueprint for how AI can enhance government research operations by enabling scientists to process complex datasets, generate hypotheses, and explore new research directions with AI that understands scientific context. It demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in advancing scientific research and national security. It also helps develop approaches that other national labs in the Department of Energy network can learn from and adapt.

"We're honored to support LLNL's mission of making the world a safer place through science and technology," said Thiyagu Ramasamy, Anthropic’s Head of Public Sector. "This partnership shows what's possible when Anthropic’s cutting-edge AI meets world-class scientific expertise."

"LLNL has always been at the cutting edge of computational science," said Greg Herweg, Chief Technology Officer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. "This expanded partnership demonstrates how frontier AI can amplify the capabilities of world-class researchers working on some of humanity's most pressing challenges."

LLNL's Claude application suite [includes](https://www.anthropic.com/enterprise) robust security features designed specifically for government environments. The platform's expanded context window can process hundreds of documents, entire codebases with 100,000+ lines, or complex datasets in a single query — enabling scientists to analyze fusion experiments, or nuclear simulations comprehensively. Enterprise security features include single sign-on (SSO), audit logging, role-based access controls, and end-to-end encryption.

## Accelerating scientific discovery with AI

LLNL scientists are using Claude across disciplines—from materials science to computational biology—with potential to drive scientific breakthroughs. By integrating Claude across their operations, LLNL researchers are able to:

* **Accelerate Scientific Discovery:** Process and analyze complex datasets, generate hypotheses, and explore new research directions with an AI assistant that understands scientific context.
* **Enhance Collaboration:** Share insights and build on collective knowledge across interdisciplinary teams potentially spanning classified and unclassified projects.
* **Streamline Operations:** Reduce time spent on routine tasks and documentation, allowing scientists to focus on high-impact research that maintains American strategic advantage in critical areas from nuclear deterrence to energy security.

## Security & compliance for national security missions

Claude supports LLNL teams working on:

* **Emergency Response:** Analyzing data from the National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center (NARAC) to respond to nuclear, radiological, chemical, or biological incidents
* **Energy Security:** Advancing fusion energy research building on LLNL's historic achievement of fusion ignition in 2022
* **Advanced Manufacturing:** Accelerating materials discovery and optimization through AI-driven analysis of 3D printing processes and manufacturing data
* **Computational Biology:** Processing vast simulation datasets to advance biosecurity research and accelerate biological threat detection capabilities
* **High-Performance Computing:** Optimizing code development and scientific computing workflows to maximize the impact of LLNL's world-class supercomputing resources

This expansion follows a successful pilot program, the first-ever [AI Jam](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-partners-with-u-s-national-labs-for-first-1-000-scientist-ai-jam) with U.S. National Labs, and the [aiEDGE for Innovation Day](https://www.llnl.gov/article/52701/llnl-employees-dive-ais-transformative-potential-aiedge-innovation-day) in March, where approximately 3,200 LLNL scientists and operational staff experienced firsthand how Claude can accelerate and enhance scientific national security research.
