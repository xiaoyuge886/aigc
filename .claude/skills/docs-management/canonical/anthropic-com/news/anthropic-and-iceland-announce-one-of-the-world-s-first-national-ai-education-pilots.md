Today, Anthropic and Iceland's Ministry of Education and Children are announcing a partnership to bring Claude to teachers across the nation, launching one of the world's first comprehensive national AI education pilots. This initiative will give teachers from every region of Iceland—from Reykjavik to the most remote villages—access to advanced AI tools as the country explores how artificial intelligence can transform education.

## **Iceland launches transformative AI education initiative**

With this new initiative, hundreds of teachers across all of Iceland will gain access to Claude to help support lesson preparation, receiving the AI technology as well as educational resources, training materials, and a dedicated support network. The pilot will explore how artificial intelligence can benefit Icelandic schools, support teachers in their instruction and preparation, and enhance student learning.

"We're proud to partner with Iceland's Ministry of Education and Children to help teachers save time and create better learning experiences for their students," **said Anthropic's Head of Public Sector Thiyagu Ramasamy.** "This initiative exemplifies how governments can harness AI to enhance public services while preserving their core values. For too long, teachers have been weighed down by paperwork and administrative tasks—hidden burdens that pull them away from what they do best: teaching. By ensuring that teachers across the country have access to Claude, Iceland is showing how nations can deploy AI practically and responsibly. Teachers can create personalized lesson plans, adapt materials for different learners, and provide students with AI-powered support whenever they need it. We're committed to supporting educators as they transform how students learn and safeguard the Icelandic language."

Teachers will be able to use Claude to analyze and interpret a wide range of content—from complex texts to mathematical problems—while the AI learns from each educator's unique teaching methods and materials. By recognizing Icelandic along with a variety of additional languages, the initiative has the potential to help teachers better support many more students, fostering more welcoming and empowering learning environments.

"Artificial intelligence is here to stay. It is developing at a tremendous pace, and it is important to harness its power while at the same time preventing harm. It will affect education just like other fields," said Guðmundur Ingi Kristinsson, Minister of Education and Children in Iceland. "Here, we take the leap and embark on an ambitious project aimed at examining the use of artificial intelligence in various areas of education, with the needs of teachers as our guiding principle and using technology from global leaders in the field. I look forward to seeing the results and discussing the next steps."

## **Building on global momentum in education and public sector**

Iceland's pioneering education pilot builds upon a growing number of governments partnering with Anthropic across Europe and beyond. The [European Parliament](https://www.claude.com/customers/european-parliament) Archives Unit has deployed Claude to make over 2.1 million official documents readily accessible, reducing document search time by 80%. In the [UK](https://www.anthropic.com/news/mou-uk-government), we've signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology to explore how AI can transform public services for UK citizens. Additionally, the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/news/latest-news-from-lse/d-april/lse-partners-with-anthropic-to-shape-the-future-of-ai-in-education) has provided all students with access to Claude for Education, helping them to solve problems and develop their critical thinking skills.

These partnerships demonstrate how European governments and institutions are thoughtfully integrating AI into public services. Iceland's comprehensive approach, focusing specifically on teachers, adds another model for how nations can harness AI to modernize education.

## **Looking forward**

This partnership marks another milestone in Anthropic's commitment to supporting educators and government workers globally.

Teachers worldwide are using Claude to save hours on lesson planning, create personalized learning materials, and provide individualized support to students, changing how education is delivered. We're building a global network of educators, students, and government teams who are pioneering AI's role in their work. These partnerships represent a core piece of our international expansion: equipping those who are transforming education, advancing scientific research, and modernizing government services for their communities.

We look forward to bringing similar partnerships to more nations as we continue to support educators, ensuring that AI serves those who serve others.
