Anthropic and Deloitte today announced an expanded alliance that will make Claude available to Deloitte people across its global network and develop new industry-specific solutions powered by Claude. As part of the collaboration, Deloitte will establish a Claude Center of Excellence with trained specialists who will develop implementation frameworks, share leading practices across deployments, and provide ongoing technical support to create the systems needed to move AI pilots to production at scale. The collaboration represents Anthropic's largest enterprise AI deployment to date, available to more than 470,000 Deloitte people.

Deloitte and Anthropic are co-creating a formal certification program to [train and certify 15,000 of its professionals](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/about/press-room/deloitte-and-anthropic-launch-certification-program.html) on Claude. These practitioners will help support Claude implementations across Deloitte's network and Deloitte’s internal AI transformation efforts.

## **Differentiated Approach**

Deloitte and Anthropic will build AI solutions, including compliance features, that companies in regulated industries–like financial services, healthcare and life sciences, and public services–can deploy. These solutions will combine Claude's safety-first design with Deloitte's Trustworthy AI™ framework, so companies can drive increased transparency into model decision making.

“Deloitte chose Claude because they need trusted AI that can help their employees and clients across industries and on a global scale—from coding and software development to customer engagement and industry-specific advisory,” said Paul Smith, Chief Commercial Officer of Anthropic. “When the world's leading organizations need to tackle complex, critical work, they choose Anthropic because Claude is built for the compliance and control that enterprises demand."

"Deloitte is making this significant investment in Anthropic’s AI platform because our approach to responsible AI is very aligned, and together we can reshape how enterprises operate over the next decade. Claude continues to be a leading choice for many clients and our own AI transformation," said Ranjit Bawa, Global Technology and Ecosystems & Alliances Leader, Deloitte Global. “This expanded relationship includes technology integration, plans for the establishment of a Center of Excellence, continued certification of 15,000 professionals, and development of industry-specific solutions as we support our clients through their AI transformations. Anthropic shares our passion for safety and reliability, along with our assessment that enterprise AI should be both powerful and principled."
