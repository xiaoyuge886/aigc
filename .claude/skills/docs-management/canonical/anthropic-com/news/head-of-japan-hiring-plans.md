# Anthropic appoints Hidetoshi Tojo as Head of Japan and announces hiring plans

Aug 6, 2025

Anthropic today announced the appointment of Hidetoshi Tojo as Head of Japan. The appointment comes as the company deepens its commitment to the Japanese market after choosing Tokyo as its first Asia office.

Hidetoshi brings extensive experience in scaling technology companies across Japan. He most recently served as Japan Country Manager at Snowflake building the local operations from the ground up to achieve significant growth. Hidetoshi has also led teams at Google Cloud Japan and Microsoft, both at US headquarters and local Japan subsidiaries.

“I’m excited to join Anthropic and look forward to supporting Japanese companies in building competitive advantages and achieving further growth through the provision of responsible AI,” said **Hidetoshi Tojo, Head of Japan at Anthropic**. “Japanese enterprises are rapidly embracing generative AI, integrating it into critical business operations, customer experiences, and development workflows. At the same time, these companies are seeking safe, secure, and trustworthy AI—something that is at the very core of Anthropic's mission and will be highly valued by Japanese companies.”

“We've seen extraordinary organic adoption since introducing Claude to Japanese power users and businesses. Rakuten, NRI, and Panasonic are already using Claude in creative ways to improve their daily operations and build new experiences,” said **Dario Amodei, CEO and co-founder of Anthropic**. “We're excited to deepen these partnerships and help more Japanese companies create transformative products and services with AI. Hidetoshi’s experience building successful teams at Snowflake, Google, and Microsoft makes him the ideal leader to drive our rapid expansion in Japan.”

Anthropic plans to officially open its first office in Asia in the coming months and expand its local operations over the next year, including hiring across various teams. Hidetoshi will focus on hiring local talent who understand Japanese market dynamics and can help serve Anthropic’s customers with the quality standards that Japanese businesses expect.

The Japanese HQ will also allow Anthropic to deepen its partnerships with businesses, policymakers, platform partners like Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud Vertex, and academic and creative industries in Japan and across Asia.
