Today we announced that Microsoft and Anthropic are [expanding our partnership](http://anthropic.com/news/microsoft-nvidia-anthropic-announce-strategic-partnerships). As part of the partnership, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5, and Opus 4.1 models are now available in public preview in Microsoft Foundry, where Azure customers can build production applications and enterprise agents.

This enables companies to build with Claude, the world's best models for coding, agents, and office tasks, all while using their existing Microsoft ecosystem. Developers can also use Claude models in Microsoft Foundry with Claude Code, our AI coding agent.

In addition to our existing integrations with [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://claude.com/blog/claude-now-available-in-microsoft-365-copilot)—where Claude powers the Researcher agent for complex, multistep research, and also enables custom agent development in Copilot Studio—Microsoft's [Agent Mode in Excel](https://aka.ms/ABSIgnite2025) now includes an option to use Claude in preview to build and edit spreadsheets directly in Excel. You can now use Claude to generate formulas, analyze data, identify errors, and iterate on solutions within an Excel spreadsheet.

For enterprises already invested in Microsoft Foundry and Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopting new AI capabilities often means navigating separate vendor contracts and billing systems—adding weeks or months of procurement overhead. These integrations remove those barriers.

## Build with Claude in Microsoft Foundry

Claude is available in Microsoft Foundry via serverless deployment, allowing developers to scale while Anthropic manages the infrastructure. This integration enables developers to:

* **Start building immediately:** Deploy Claude through Foundry's APIs, tools, and workflows
* **Use your existing Azure agreements:** Claude is eligible for Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC), and works with current Azure agreements and billing, eliminating separate vendor approvals
* **Build in your preferred language:** Access Claude using Python, TypeScript, and C# SDKs with Microsoft Entra authentication

Claude is available in the Global Standard deployment rolling out today, using our standard API pricing, with the US DataZone coming soon. Visit our [pricing page](https://claude.com/pricing#api) for details.

## Select the right model for your use case

Microsoft customers can access Claude's frontier models directly in Foundry.

**Sonnet 4.5** is the best coding model in the world and the strongest model for building complex agents. Use Sonnet 4.5 when you need state-of-the-art performance on sophisticated reasoning, multi-step agentic workflows, and autonomous coding tasks.

**Haiku 4.5** is our fastest model and delivers near-frontier performance at one-third the cost of Sonnet. Deploy Haiku 4.5 for high-volume applications like sub-agents, customer support automation, content moderation, or real-time coding assistance where speed and cost-efficiency are critical.

**Opus 4.1** is an exceptional model for specialized reasoning tasks. Use Opus 4.1 for complex, multi-step problems that require sustained focus and rigorous attention to detail.

All models support a variety of Claude Developer Platform capabilities in Foundry, including the [code execution tool](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool), [web search](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool) and [fetch](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool), [citations](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/citations), [vision](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/vision), [tool use](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/implement-tool-use), [prompt caching](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching), and more. Explore our [documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/overview) for additional supported features.
