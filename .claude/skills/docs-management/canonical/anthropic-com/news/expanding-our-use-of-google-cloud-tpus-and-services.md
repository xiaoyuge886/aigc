Today, we are announcing that we plan to expand our use of Google Cloud technologies, including up to one million TPUs, dramatically increasing our compute resources as we continue to push the boundaries of AI research and product development. The expansion is worth tens of billions of dollars and is expected to bring well over a gigawatt of capacity online in 2026.

“Anthropic’s choice to significantly expand its usage of TPUs reflects the strong price-performance and efficiency its teams have seen with TPUs for several years,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO at Google Cloud. “We are continuing to innovate and drive further efficiencies and increased capacity of our TPUs, building on our already mature AI accelerator portfolio, including our seventh generation TPU, Ironwood.”

Anthropic now serves more than 300,000 business customers, and our number of large accounts—customers that each represent more than $100,000 in run-rate revenue—has grown nearly 7x in the past year. This expansion will help us serve this rapidly growing customer demand. These greater computational resources will also power more thorough testing, alignment research, and responsible deployment at scale.

“Anthropic and Google have a longstanding partnership and this latest expansion will help us continue to grow the compute we need to define the frontier of AI,” said Krishna Rao, CFO of Anthropic. “Our customers—from Fortune 500 companies to AI-native startups—depend on Claude for their most important work, and this expanded capacity ensures we can meet our exponentially growing demand while keeping our models at the cutting edge of the industry.”

Anthropic’s unique compute strategy focuses on a diversified approach that efficiently uses three chip platforms–Google’s TPUs, Amazon’s Trainium, and NVIDIA’s GPUs. This multi-platform approach ensures we can continue advancing Claude's capabilities while maintaining strong partnerships across the industry. We remain committed to our partnership with Amazon, our primary training partner and cloud provider, and continue to work with the company on Project Rainier, a massive compute cluster with hundreds of thousands of AI chips across multiple U.S. data centers.

Anthropic will continue to invest in additional compute capacity to ensure our models and capabilities remain at the frontier.
