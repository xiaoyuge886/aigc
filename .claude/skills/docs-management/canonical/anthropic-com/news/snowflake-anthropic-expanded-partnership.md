Dec 3, 2025

Today, we announce a significant expansion of our strategic partnership with Snowflake. The multi-year, $200 million agreement will not only make Anthropic’s Claude models available in the Snowflake platform to more than 12,600 global customers across Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, and Microsoft Azure, but also establishes a joint go-to-market (GTM) initiative focused on deploying AI agents across the world's largest enterprises. The partnership enables enterprises to gain insights from both structured and unstructured data using Claude, while maintaining rigorous security standards.

Snowflake uses Claude widely for internal operations as well. Claude Code enhances developer productivity and innovation across Snowflake's engineering organization, while a Claude-powered GTM AI Assistant built on [Snowflake Intelligence](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/snowflake-intelligence/) enables sales teams to centralize data, ask questions in natural language, and find the answers that speed up deal cycles.

Thousands of Snowflake customers already process trillions of Claude tokens per month through [Snowflake Cortex AI](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/cortex/). The next phase of the partnership focuses on deploying AI agents capable of handling complex, multi-step analysis, powered by Claude's advanced reasoning and Snowflake's governed data and AI environment. Business users can ask questions in plain English. Claude figures out what data is needed, pulls it from across the company's Snowflake environment, and delivers the answer, with **greater than 90% accuracy** on complex text-to-SQL tasks based on Snowflake's internal benchmarks.

By combining Claude's reasoning capabilities with Snowflake's governed data environment, customers in regulated industries like financial services, healthcare, and life sciences can move from pilots to production with confidence.

"Enterprises have spent years building secure, trusted data environments, and now they want AI that can work within those environments without compromise," **said Dario Amodei, CEO and Co-Founder of Anthropic**. "This partnership brings Claude directly into Snowflake, where that data already lives. It's a meaningful step toward making frontier AI genuinely useful for businesses."

"Snowflake's most strategic partnerships are measured not just in scale, but in the depth of innovation and customer value that we can create together," **said Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of Snowflake**. "Anthropic joins a very select group of partners where we have nine-figure alignment, co-innovation at the product level, and a proven track record of executing together for customers worldwide. Together, the combined power of Claude and Snowflake is raising the bar for how enterprises deploy scalable, context-aware AI on top of their most critical business data."

## **What the partnership delivers: enterprise-ready AI**

By bringing Claude directly to enterprise data in Snowflake, customers can gain insights from both structured and unstructured data, while maintaining rigorous security standards. Key benefits of the partnership include:

* **Enterprise intelligence powered by Claude:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 powers Snowflake Intelligence, an enterprise intelligence agent that provides answers from structured and unstructured data using natural language.
* **Multimodal analysis across all data types:** Through [Snowflake Cortex AI Functions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/aisql), customers can use Claude models—including Claude Opus 4.5, which Snowflake hosted on day one—to query text, images, audio, and traditional tabular data, all using SQL.
* **Building custom multi-agent solutions:** [Snowflake Cortex Agents](https://www.snowflake.com/en/developers/guides/getting-started-with-cortex-agents/) enables customers to build production-ready data agents powered by Claude. These agents retrieve and reason over structured and unstructured data with built-in accuracy and efficiency.
* **Built-in governance and observability:** [Snowflake Horizon Catalog](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/horizon/) provides end-to-end governance and responsible AI controls, so teams in regulated industries can move AI agents from pilots to production with confidence.

## **Customers are already seeing results**

By combining Claude's reasoning capabilities with Snowflake's governed data and AI environment, customers across any industry can deploy agents that understand extensive context across customer data—and show their work rather than just retrieve an answer.

For example, **Simon Data**, a composable customer data platform provider, [uses Claude on Snowflake](https://www.claude.com/customers/snowflake) to uncover previously hidden patterns and relationships in their data while maintaining strict governance standards.

**Intercom**, which builds AI-first customer service software, uses Claude through Snowflake Cortex AI to power its Fin AI Agent.

"This has transformed how we work with our customers to achieve increased Fin AI Agent automation rates for their support volume," **said Dave Lynch, VP Engineering at Intercom**. "Our engagements, especially with our biggest, most demanding customers, are holistically more efficient and more effective. We can do things we simply could not feasibly do before."

A wealth management firm can use Snowflake Intelligence, powered by Claude, to create an agent that synthesizes client holdings with relevant market data and compliance rules to generate personalized portfolio recommendations—all within the security and governance perimeter of Snowflake's AI Data Cloud.

## **Getting started**
