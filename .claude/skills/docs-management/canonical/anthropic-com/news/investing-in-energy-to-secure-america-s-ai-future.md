# Investing in energy to secure America's AI future

Jul 15, 2025

Energy is central to winning the AI race and we need to ensure that America has the necessary infrastructure to maintain its lead. This includes reliable, abundant energy sources and modernized electric grids capable of supporting the computational and energy demands of advanced AI systems.

The importance of building this infrastructure goes beyond just powering data centers—the country that controls the energy to train and deploy frontier AI models will shape the future of global innovation, economic competitiveness, and democratic values. We believe America should be at the forefront and we need commitment that crosses political lines.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei shared these priorities today at the inaugural [Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit](https://www.mccormick.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-dave-mccormick-and-president-donald-j-trump-to-announce-record-setting-90-billion-in-energy-and-innovation-investments-for-pennsylvania/) at Carnegie Mellon University, joining President Trump, Senator Dave McCormick, and leaders from across the technology and energy sectors. As part of this, we are announcing a contribution of $2 million towards programs at Carnegie Mellon University. Our investment will support two critical areas: advancing AI-powered energy solutions and building the cybersecurity workforce needed to protect America's energy infrastructure. The funding is divided equally between two strategic initiatives:

* $1 million to support energy research as a grand challenge partner of the [Scott Institute for Energy Innovation](https://energy.cmu.edu/index.html), leveraging AI to automate and optimize grid management, driving energy efficiency and resilience. The Scott Institute is Carnegie Mellon's hub for advancing collaborative research, strategic partnerships, policy outreach, entrepreneurship, and education focused on the future of energy. Its Grand Challenge Partnership Program was established in 2023 to accelerate research on some of the most challenging questions facing the energy transition.
* $1 million to support the [picoCTF program](https://picoctf.org/) at Carnegie Mellon University. This program is designed to provide middle and high school students with a free cybersecurity education to learn skills through capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions. It provides hands-on challenges covering topics like cryptography, web exploitation, forensics, and reverse engineering. These cybersecurity skills form the critical building blocks for securing our energy infrastructure and other critical systems in the years to come.

These investments are just the beginning. We also believe that AI will be a powerful tool to support emissions reductions, advance clean energy innovation, and streamline efficiencies. We plan to continue making investments in this area and are actively looking to partner with organizations who are working to study and find solutions to reduce negative environmental impacts.

By partnering across government, industry, and communities, we can build the foundation for decades of American leadership in AI—creating jobs, strengthening our energy independence, and ensuring the transformative benefits of AI are realized in the United States. We look forward to continuing to work with the U.S. government and other industry partners towards achieving this goal.
