Today we're announcing plans to open an office in Seoul in early 2026 as our global operations expand into Korea. Seoul comes on the heels of new offices in Tokyo and Bengaluru, and together this expansion reflects the extraordinary momentum we're seeing across Asia-Pacific—our run rate revenue in the region has grown over 10x in the past year.

The Korean government recently announced plans to become one of the world’s top three hubs of AI development. Anthropic leaders will visit Seoul next week to meet with customers and partners and signal our commitment to helping Korea meet their ambitious AI goals.

Korean users are among Claude's most active globally, ranking in the top five both in total usage and per capita usage according to our [Economic Index](https://www.anthropic.com/economic-index). More than a quarter of our Claude Code user base now comes from countries in Asia-Pacific, with Korea showing particularly strong growth—the number of active weekly Claude Code users in Korea has grown 6x in the past four months. The developer community in Korea is one of our strongest worldwide, and a Korean software engineer currently ranks as the world's top Claude Code user, exemplifying the depth of technical talent and adoption in the market.

"Korea is at the forefront of AI innovation in Asia and we’ve already seen strong adoption of Claude in the region," said Dario Amodei, Anthropic CEO and co-founder. "We built Claude to deliver both frontier capabilities and the safeguards needed for responsible deployment, and our local partnerships in Korea will help demonstrate what's possible when advanced AI meets Korea's world-class technical ecosystem and forward-thinking institutions.”

Korean companies aren't just adopting AI—they're defining how entire industries deploy it around the world. [Law&Company](https://claude.com/customers/law-and-company) uses Claude to power their AI legal assistant, nearly doubling lawyer efficiency rates and doing so with the high level of accuracy required in legal work. Korea’s largest telecommunications company, [SK Telecom](https://www.claude.com/customers/skt), chose Claude to create a custom AI customer service model that’s become a blueprint for the entire telco industry. With world-class tech companies, a thriving startup scene, and advanced frameworks for AI ethics and safety, we see remarkable promise in Korea’s innovation ecosystem. Our number of large business accounts in Asia-Pacific—customers that each represent over $100,000 in run-rate revenue—has grown 8x in the past year.

“Korean businesses are already some of the world’s most sophisticated users of Claude, particularly for complex coding and enterprise applications,” said Paul Smith, Chief Commercial Officer of Anthropic. "Having a local presence means we can work more closely with these world-class enterprises and startups and give them the unique support they need.”

Our focus in Korea will be closely aligned with Korea's national strategy to become a global AI leader. We look forward to working closely with Korean government agencies, research institutions, and industry partners to advance responsible AI development and deployment across key sectors.

We're building a comprehensive local team focused on supporting Korea's unique business landscape and technological needs. For information about career opportunities at our new Seoul office, visit [anthropic.com/careers](https://www.anthropic.com/careers).
