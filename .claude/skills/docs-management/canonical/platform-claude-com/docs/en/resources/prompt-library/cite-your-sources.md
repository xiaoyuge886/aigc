# Cite your sources

Get answers to questions about a document's content with relevant citations supporting the response.

<Tip>We recommend using the [citation feature](/docs/en/build-with-claude/citations) built into the API instead of a prompt based approach. Using the API citation feature will improve citation quality, ensure that all returned citations are valid, and potentially reduce the number of needed output tokens.</Tip>

| System | You are an expert research assistant. Here is a document you will answer questions about: <br/> <doc> [Full text of [Matterport SEC filing 10-K 2023](https://investors.matterport.com/node/9501/html), not pasted here for brevity] </doc> <br/><br/> First, find the quotes from the document that are most relevant to answering the question, and then print them in numbered order. Quotes should be relatively short. <br/><br/> If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead. <br/><br/> Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:". Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Instead make references to quotes relevant to each section of the answer solely by adding their bracketed numbers at the end of relevant sentences. <br/><br/> Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags. Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly. <example> <br/> Quotes: <br/> [1] "Company X reported revenue of \$12 million in 2021." <br/> [2] "Almost 90% of revenue came from widget sales, with gadget sales making up the remaining 10%." <br/><br/> Answer: <br/> Company X earned \$12 million. [1] Almost 90% of it was from widget sales. [2] <br/> </example> <br/><br/> If the question cannot be answered by the document, say so. |
| User | Is Matterport doing well? |

## Example output

Quotes:  
 \[1\] "We have recently experienced rapid growth. Our subscribers have grown approximately 49-fold from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Our revenue increased by approximately 22% to \$136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from approximately \$111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021."  
 \[2\] "Our gross profit decreased by \$8.1 million or 14%, to \$51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from \$60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to certain disruptive and incremental costs due to the global supply chain constraints in fiscal year 2022."  
 \[3\] "Our net dollar expansion rate of 103% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 demonstrates the stickiness and growth potential of our platform."

Answer:  
 Matterport has experienced rapid subscriber and revenue growth in recent years. \[1\] However, their gross profit declined in 2022 due to supply chain issues. \[2\] Their net dollar expansion rate indicates strong subscriber retention and potential for continued growth. \[3\] Overall, despite the dip in gross profit, Matterport's subscriber and revenue growth, along with their platform's stickiness, suggest the company is doing relatively well.
