# Keep Claude in character with role prompting and prefilling

---

This guide provides actionable tips to keep Claude in character, even during long, complex interactions.

- **Use system prompts to set the role:** Use [system prompts](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts) to define Claude's role and personality. This sets a strong foundation for consistent responses.
    <Tip>When setting up the character, provide detailed information about the personality, background, and any specific traits or quirks. This will help the model better emulate and generalize the character's traits.</Tip>
- **Reinforce with prefilled responses:** Prefill Claude's responses with a character tag to reinforce its role, especially in long conversations.
- **Prepare Claude for possible scenarios:** Provide a list of common scenarios and expected responses in your prompts. This "trains" Claude to handle diverse situations without breaking character.
