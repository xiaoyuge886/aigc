# Claude Code Analytics API

Programmatically access your organization's Claude Code usage analytics and productivity metrics with the Claude Code Analytics Admin API.

---

<Tip>
**The Admin API is unavailable for individual accounts.** To collaborate with teammates and add members, set up your organization in **Console → Settings → Organization**.
</Tip>

The Claude Code Analytics Admin API provides programmatic access to daily aggregated usage metrics for Claude Code users, enabling organizations to analyze developer productivity and build custom dashboards. This API bridges the gap between our basic [Analytics dashboard](/claude-code) and the complex OpenTelemetry integration.

This API enables you to better monitor, analyze, and optimize your Claude Code adoption:

* **Developer Productivity Analysis:** Track sessions, lines of code added/removed, commits, and pull requests created using Claude Code
* **Tool Usage Metrics:** Monitor acceptance and rejection rates for different Claude Code tools (Edit, Write, NotebookEdit)
* **Cost Analysis:** View estimated costs and token usage broken down by Claude model
* **Custom Reporting:** Export data to build executive dashboards and reports for management teams
* **Usage Justification:** Provide metrics to justify and expand Claude Code adoption internally

<Check>
  **Admin API key required**
  
  This API is part of the [Admin API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/administration-api). These endpoints require an Admin API key (starting with `sk-ant-admin...`) that differs from standard API keys. Only organization members with the admin role can provision Admin API keys through the [Claude Console](/settings/admin-keys).
</Check>

## Quick start

Get your organization's Claude Code analytics for a specific day:

```bash
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/usage_report/claude_code?\
starting_at=2025-09-08&\
limit=20" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

<Tip>
  **Set a User-Agent header for integrations**
  
  If you're building an integration, set your User-Agent header to help us understand usage patterns:
  ```
  User-Agent: YourApp/1.0.0 (https://yourapp.com)
  ```
</Tip>

## Claude Code Analytics API

Track Claude Code usage, productivity metrics, and developer activity across your organization with the `/v1/organizations/usage_report/claude_code` endpoint.

### Key concepts

- **Daily aggregation**: Returns metrics for a single day specified by the `starting_at` parameter
- **User-level data**: Each record represents one user's activity for the specified day
- **Productivity metrics**: Track sessions, lines of code, commits, pull requests, and tool usage
- **Token and cost data**: Monitor usage and estimated costs broken down by Claude model
- **Cursor-based pagination**: Handle large datasets with stable pagination using opaque cursors
- **Data freshness**: Metrics are available with up to 1-hour delay for consistency

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see the [Claude Code Analytics API reference](/docs/en/api/admin-api/claude-code/get-claude-code-usage-report).

### Basic examples

#### Get analytics for a specific day

```bash
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/usage_report/claude_code?\
starting_at=2025-09-08" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

#### Get analytics with pagination

```bash
# First request
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/usage_report/claude_code?\

  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

      ]
    }
  ],
  "has_more": false,
  "next_page": null
}
```

## Pagination

The API supports cursor-based pagination for organizations with large numbers of users:

1. Make your initial request with optional `limit` parameter
2. If `has_more` is `true` in the response, use the `next_page` value in your next request
3. Continue until `has_more` is `false`

The cursor encodes the position of the last record and ensures stable pagination even as new data arrives. Each pagination session maintains a consistent data boundary to ensure you don't miss or duplicate records.

## Common use cases

- **Executive dashboards**: Create high-level reports showing Claude Code impact on development velocity
- **AI tool comparison**: Export metrics to compare Claude Code with other AI coding tools like Copilot and Cursor
- **Developer productivity analysis**: Track individual and team productivity metrics over time
- **Cost tracking and allocation**: Monitor spending patterns and allocate costs by team or project
- **Adoption monitoring**: Identify which teams and users are getting the most value from Claude Code
- **ROI justification**: Provide concrete metrics to justify and expand Claude Code adoption internally

## Frequently asked questions

### How fresh is the analytics data?
Claude Code analytics data typically appears within 1 hour of user activity completion. To ensure consistent pagination results, only data older than 1 hour is included in responses.

### Can I get real-time metrics?
No, this API provides daily aggregated metrics only. For real-time monitoring, consider using the [OpenTelemetry integration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/monitoring-usage).

### How are users identified in the data?
Users are identified through the `actor` field in two ways:
- **`user_actor`**: Contains `email_address` for users who authenticate via OAuth (most common)
- **`api_actor`**: Contains `api_key_name` for users who authenticate via API key

The `customer_type` field indicates whether the usage is from `api` customers (API PAYG) or `subscription` customers (Pro/Team plans).

### What's the data retention period?
Historical Claude Code analytics data is retained and accessible through the API. There is no specified deletion period for this data.

### Which Claude Code deployments are supported?
This API only tracks Claude Code usage on the Claude API (1st party). Usage on Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or other third-party platforms is not included.

### What does it cost to use this API?
The Claude Code Analytics API is free to use for all organizations with access to the Admin API.

### How do I calculate tool acceptance rates?
Tool acceptance rate = `accepted / (accepted + rejected)` for each tool type. For example, if the edit tool shows 45 accepted and 5 rejected, the acceptance rate is 90%.

### What time zone is used for the date parameter?
All dates are in UTC. The `starting_at` parameter should be in YYYY-MM-DD format and represents UTC midnight for that day.
