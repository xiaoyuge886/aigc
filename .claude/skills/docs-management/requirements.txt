# Python dependencies for claude-docs skill
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# For agentic tools (Claude Code, etc.):
#   python .claude/skills/claude-docs/scripts/setup_dependencies.py --install-required
#
# Or install manually:
#   pip install -r .claude/skills/claude-docs/requirements.txt

# Core dependencies (required)
pyyaml>=6.0
requests>=2.28.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.11.0
markdownify>=0.11.6

# NLP libraries (optional but recommended)
# spaCy: Install model after installing package
#   Recommended: python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
#   For specific version: python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm-3.7.1
#   Check version: python -m spacy info en_core_web_sm
# Note: Model version affects stop word lists - use consistent versions across environments
spacy>=3.7.0
yake>=0.4.8

# File format support (for docx and pdf parsing)
python-docx>=1.1.0  # For .docx file parsing
pdfplumber>=0.10.0  # For .pdf file parsing (recommended, better than PyPDF2)
PyPDF2>=3.0.0  # Alternative PDF parser (fallback if pdfplumber not available)

# Notes:
# - If spaCy is not available, scripts fall back to basic stop words
# - If YAKE is not available, keyword extraction uses heading/content analysis only
# - All scripts work without optional dependencies (with reduced functionality)
# - For docx/pdf support: Install python-docx and pdfplumber (or PyPDF2)
#
# Installation Notes:
# - Pre-built wheels are preferred (no compiler needed) - auto-installation tries these first
# - If wheels aren't available for your Python version, source install may require C++ build tools
# - Python 3.11/3.12 have better pre-built wheel support than newer versions
# - On Windows without build tools: scripts work fine with fallbacks (no action needed)
# - pdfplumber may require additional system dependencies (poppler-utils) on Linux
